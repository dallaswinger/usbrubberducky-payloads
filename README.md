<p align="center"><i> New USB Rubber Ducky (A+C, DuckyScript 3.0, 2022)</i></p>

Computers trust humans. Humans use keyboards. Hence the universal spec — HID, or Human Interface Device.

A keyboard presents itself as a HID, and in turn it's inherently trusted as human by the computer.

The USB Rubber Ducky — which looks like an innocent flash drive to humans — takes advantage of this trust to deliver powerful payloads, injecting keystrokes at superhuman speeds. 

Easily automate any task you can perform with a keyboard with an easy to learn language designed specifically for the USB Rubber Ducky.

# About DuckyScript™

## Legacy DuckyScript (1.0)
Hak5 introduced Keystroke Injection in 2010 with the USB Rubber Ducky™. This technique, developed by Hak5 founder Darren Kitchen, was his weapon of choice for automating mundane tasks at his IT job — fixing printers, network shares and the like.
Today the USB Rubber Ducky is a hacker culture icon, synonymous with the keystroke injection technique it pioneered. It’s found its way into the hearts and toolkits of Cybersecurity and IT pros the world over — including many movies and TV shows!
Core to its success is its simple language, DuckyScript™. Originally just three commands, it could be learned by anyone—regardless of experience—in minutes.

<b> With the new USB Rubber Ducky in 2022, DuckyScript 3.0 has been introduced.</b>
## DuckyScript 3.0
DuckyScript 3.0 is a feature rich, structured programming language. It includes all of the previously available commands and features of the original DuckyScript.

<b>(DuckyScript 3.0 is backwards compatible with DuckyScript 1.0; this means all your favorite DuckyScript 1.0 paylaods are valid DuckyScript 3.0) </b>

Additionally, DuckyScript 3.0 introduces [control flow constructs](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/operators-conditions-loops-and-functions/conditional-statements "View Documentation"), [loops](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/operators-conditions-loops-and-functions/loops "View Documentation"), [functions](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/operators-conditions-loops-and-functions/functions "View Documentation"), [extensions](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/advanced-features/extensions "View Documentation").
Plus, DuckyScript 3.0 includes many features specific to [keystroke injection](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/ducky-script-basics/keystroke-injection "View Documentation") attack/automation, such as [HID & Storage attack modes](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/attack-modes-constants-and-variables/attack-modes "View Documentation"), OS Detection, [Keystroke Reflection](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/advanced-features/exfiltration#the-keystroke-reflection-attack "View Documentation") ([Video + Whitepaper](https://shop.hak5.org/pages/keystroke-reflection "Keystroke Reflection Video + Whitepaper")), [jitter](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/advanced-features/jitter "View Documentation") and [randomization](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/advanced-features/randomization "View Documentation") to name a few.

While many of the Hak5 Tools run various versions of DuckyScript; unlike the [Bash Bunny](https://shop.hak5.org/products/bash-bunny), [Key Croc](https://shop.hak5.org/products/key-croc) and even the [officially licenced DuckyScript compatible devices from O.MG](https://shop.hak5.org/collections/mischief-gadgets/ "O.MG") - which use `INTERPRETED` versions of DuckyScript - the USB Rubber Ducky uses `COMPILED inject.bin` payloads. 


_Interpreted DuckyScript means the payload runs straight from `source code` (the code you write e.g. `DELAY 1000`)._

_Compiled DuckyScript means that there is both `source code` and an `inject.bin` generated from the source code. (DuckyScript 1.0 was "encoded" rather than "compiled" - references to either mean the same)_

The files in this repository are _the source code_ in the form of `payload.txt` files.

## DuckyScript Ecosystem

<h3><a href='https://github.com/dallaswinger/usbrubberducky-payloads/blob/master/languages'>Languages </a></h3>
Support for different keyboard layouts can be found, modified or contributed to in the <b><a href='https://github.com/dallaswinger/usbrubberducky-payloads/blob/master/languages'> languages/ </a></b> directory of this repository.

Compiling payloads for the correct language / keyboard layout has never been easier:

<a href='https://payloadstudio.hak5.org'> Open PayloadStudio \> Settings \> Compiler Settings</a> 

PayloadStudio includes all the languages provided in this repo built-in for your convenience. 

<a href="https://hak5.org/products/payload-studio-pro">PayloadStudio Pro</a> has a <b>dedicated language editor</b> specifically for editing and building language files! 

The default language is US <a href='https://github.com/dallaswinger/usbrubberducky-payloads/blob/master/languages/us.json'>(languages/us.json)</a>

<h3><a href="https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/advanced-features/extensions">Extensions</a></h3>
It should be clear by now that so much is possible with DuckyScript 3.0. The combination of  keystroke injection with various attack modes, logic and data processing, along with the built-in features like randomization and internal variables — the possibilities for advanced payload functions seems endless.

</p>

As the payload library continues to grow, so too will the DuckyScript 3.0 language. To that end, the extensions feature of the language and editor facilitate the continued growth of the language.
<b>Extensions are blocks of reusable code which may be implemented in any payload. Think of them as snippets, or building blocks, upon which your next payload may benefit.</b>
While Hak5 developers cannot envision all possible use cases for the USB Rubber Ducky, the DuckyScript language has been architected in such a way so that the community as a whole may gain new features and abilities with each contributed extension.

Once you have developed your payload, you are encouraged to contribute to this repository by submitting a Pull Request. Reviewed and Approved pull requests will add your payload to this repository, where they may be publically available.

# Please adhere to the following best practices and style guides when submitting a payload.
### Purely Desctructive payloads will not be accepted. No, it's not "just a prank".
Subject to change. Please ensure any submissions meet the [latest version](https://github.com/hak5/usbrubberducky-payloads/blob/master/README.md) of these standards before submitting a Pull Request.


## Naming Conventions
Please give your payload a unique, descriptive and appropriate name. Do not use spaces in payload, directory or file names. Each payload should be submit into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used in place of spaces, to one of the categories such as exfiltration, phishing, remote_access or recon. Do not create your own category.

## Payload Configuration
In many cases, payloads will require some level of configuration by the end payload user. Be sure to take the following into careful consideration to ensure your payload is easily tested, used and maintained. 

- Abstract configuration(s) for ease of use. Use `DEFINE` where possible.
- Remember to use PLACEHOLDERS for configurable portions of your payload - do not share your personal URLs, API keys, Passphrases, etc...
- Make note of both required and optional configuration(s) in your payload using comments at the top of your payload or "inline" where applicable
<pre>
Example: 
	BEGINNING OF PAYLOAD 
	... Payload Documentation... 

	REM Configuration
	REM REQUIRED - Provide URL used for Example
	DEFINE MY_TARGET_URL example.com
	REM OPTIONAL - How long until payload starts; default 5s
	DEFINE BOOT_DELAY 5000
	REM End Configuration
	...
	DELAY 5000
	...
	STRING MY_TARGET_URL
	...
</pre>
## Payload Documentation 
Payloads should begin with `REM` comments specifying the title of the payload, the author, the target, and a brief description.
<pre>
Example:
	BEGINNING OF PAYLOAD

	REM Title: Example Payload
	REM Author: Korben Dallas
	REM Description: Opens hidden powershell and
	REM Target: Windows 10
	REM Props: Hak5, Darren Kitchen, Korben
	REM Version: 1.0
	REM Category: General
