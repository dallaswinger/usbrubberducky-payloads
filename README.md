# About the USB Rubber Ducky and DuckyScript™
A "flash drive" that types keystroke injection payloads into unsuspecting devices at incredible speeds.

<p align="center"><i> New USB Rubber Ducky (A+C, DuckyScript 3.0, 2022)</i></p>

## Legacy DuckyScript™ 1.0
Hak5 introduced Keystroke Injection in 2010 with the USB Rubber Ducky™. This technique, developed by Hak5 founder Darren Kitchen, was his weapon of choice for automating mundane tasks at his IT job — fixing printers, network shares and the like.
Today the USB Rubber Ducky is a hacker culture icon, synonymous with the keystroke injection technique it pioneered. It’s found its way into the hearts and toolkits of Cybersecurity and IT pros the world over — including many movies and TV shows!
Core to its success is its simple language, DuckyScript™. Originally just three commands, it could be learned by anyone—regardless of experience—in minutes.

## DuckyScript™ 3.0
With the new USB Rubber Ducky in 2022, DuckyScript 3.0 has been introduced.
DuckyScript 3.0 is a feature rich, structured programming language. It includes all of the previously available commands and features of the original DuckyScript.

<b>(DuckyScript 3.0 is backwards compatible with DuckyScript 1.0; this means all your favorite DuckyScript 1.0 paylaods are valid DuckyScript 3.0) </b>

Additionally, DuckyScript 3.0 introduces control flow constructs (if/else if/else), repetition (loops), functions, extensions.
Plus, DuckyScript 3.0 includes many features specific to keystroke injection attack/automation, such as HID & Storage attack modes, OS Detection, [Keystroke Reflection](https://shop.hak5.org/pages/keystroke-reflection "Keystroke Reflection"), jitter and randomization to name a few.
[This documentation](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/ "This documentation") will cover the basics, then introduce each of the new features such that they build upon one another.

## Contributing
Once you have developed your payload, you are encouraged to contribute to this repository by submitting a Pull Request. Reviewed and Approved pull requests will add your payload to this repository, where they may be publically available.

### Please adhere to the following best practices and style guide when submitting a payload.

### Naming Conventions
Please give your payload a unique, descriptive and appropriate name. Do not use spaces in payload, directory or file names. Each payload should be submit into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used in place of spaces, to one of the categories such as exfiltration, phishing, remote_access or recon. Do not create your own category.

### Payload Configuration
In many cases, payloads will require some level of configuration by the end payload user. Be sure to take the following into careful consideration to ensure your payload is easily tested, used and maintained. 

- Abstract configuration(s) for ease of use. Use `DEFINE` where possible.
- Remember to use PLACEHOLDERS for configurable portions of your payload - do not share your personal URLs, API keys, Passphrases, etc...
- Make note of both required and optional configuration(s) in your payload using comments at the top of your payload or "inline" where applicable
<pre>
Example: 
	REM Configuration
	REM REQUIRED - Provide URL used for <something> 
	DEFINE MY_TARGET_URL example.com
	REM OPTIONAL - How long until payload starts; default 5s
	DEFINE BOOT_DELAY 5000
	REM End Configuration
	...
	DELAY 5000
	...
	STRING MY_TARGET_URL
	...
</pre>
### Payload Documentation 
Payloads should begin with `REM` comments specifying the title of the payload, the author, the target, and a brief description.
<pre>
Example:
	REM Title: Example Payload
	REM Author: Korben Dallas
	REM Description: Opens hidden powershell and ...
	REM Target: Windows 10
